# ðŸ¦™ OKIE5-Ollama4Grasshopper

**OKIE5-Ollama4Rhino** is a powerful Rhino Grasshopper plugin that connects your local Grasshopper environment to large language models (LLMs) running on [Ollama](https://ollama.com), enabling natural language design workflows, agentic command routing, and real-time context-aware modeling.

Developed by **OKIE5**, this plugin bridges Rhino with LLM AI-assisted design tools providing a fully local, secure, and license-transparent plugin.

Access Ollama locally through your Rhino8/Grasshopper interface using our custom plugin at Food4Rhino!
